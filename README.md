# EO bookmarks
---

## Description
Nothing special, just a very basic website bookmarking tool forged from _Javascript_, _HTML_ and _CSS_, no libraries were used aside from [Twitter's Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) which has some little to no dependency on [jQuery,](https://jquery.com/) so that's a bit tricky to conclude.
You can easily input a URL and a corresponding label, after a light form validation, your bookmark is added, you can also easily remove it pressing the delete button on the right.
> **Note**: All bookmarks are saved in your local storage.
